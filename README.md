# CitiBike-2022
Trip data analysis to illuminate distribution problems of NYC's popular bikesharing provider CitiBike during 2022

### Objective

Imagine you’re the lead analyst for a bike-sharing service based in New York City, USA. Your team has been tasked with analyzing user behavior to help the business strategy department assess the current logistics model of bike distribution across the city and identify expansion opportunities. The project’s objective is to conduct a descriptive analysis of existing data and discover actionable insights for the business strategy team to help make informed decisions that will circumvent availability issues and ensure the company’s position as a leader in eco-friendly transportation solutions in the city. 

### Context

For this project, you’ll be using public data from New York bike-sharing facilities operated by Citi Bike. For context, Citi Bike’s popularity has increased since its launch in 2013. The company’s marketing strategy promotes bike sharing as a sustainable and convenient means of transportation, which has been very successful. Since the Covid–19 pandemic, New York residents have found even more merit in bike sharing, creating higher demand. This has led to distribution problems—such as fewer bikes at popular bike stations or stations full of docked bikes, making it difficult to return a hired bike—and customer complaints. As the lead analyst, your task is to diagnose where distribution issues stem from and advise higher management on a solution based on your diagnosis of the root of the problem—whether it’s sheer numbers, seasonal demand, or something else. Being in a management position also makes you the bridge between divisions, which requires you to ensure the information is tangible for the business development team. To effectively communicate your analysis to non-analysts, you’ll present your insights in an interactive dashboard depicting the metrics you identify as vital for tackling the distribution issues.

### Data and Tool Requirements

For this project, you’ll use open source data from the Citi Bike database for the year 2022. To enrich this data set, you’ll gather weather data using NOAA’s API service. You will then use Python libraries, including Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly to make charts; pandas and Kepler.gl, to create maps; and Streamlit to design your final dashboard.
